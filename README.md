# Knowledge Testing Console Application

## Description

This is a console application developed for the largest programming training center in Ukraine. The application aims to solve the business problem of testing the knowledge of graduates to create a ranking and identify the best candidates for employment.

## Installation

The application is a runnable JAR file. The path to an encrypted file, which contains both input and output data, is passed to the program.

## Usage

### Input Data
The input data is a Java test with a list of 10 questions with correct answers and time for each question.

### Output Data
The output data includes the first and last name of the test taker, the date and time when the test was taken, the result in percentage, and all the answers.

### Roles
The application provides for the role of a student and a mentor. Authentication and data encryption are mandatory requirements.

## Development

The console application is a minimum viable product (MVP) that demonstrates basic skills in development, design, and coding in Java. The application uses design patterns, such as the Decorator pattern. The choice of technology is not a concern at this stage.

In the future, we plan to develop a full-fledged web application based on this prototype.

## Note
For demonstration purposes, the number of test attempts is set to 1. The mentor has the ability to view not only the student's result but also all their answers.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
